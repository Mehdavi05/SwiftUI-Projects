Explanation
Animation Logic:

The @FocusState property wrapper is used to monitor whether the SecureField is currently focused.
The .focused modifier binds the SecureField's focus state to isPasswordFieldFocused.
This focus state is used to determine whether the eye icon should appear "closed" (eye.slash.fill) or "open" (eye.fill).
Eye Animation:

SwiftUI's animation modifier is applied to the Image to smoothly transition between the two states.
TextField and SecureField:

A TextField is used for the username.
A SecureField is used for the password, with onTapGesture to detect focus.
Styling:

RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle is used for a simple design.
The login button has a rounded, blue background for a clean look.
